 * The mobile app is built using React Native, while the backend is powered by Flask.

 * The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that explains the training process in detail, providing a deeper understanding of the model. It also showcases the usage of data augmentation, transfer learning and other techniques.

# Why
This project was created as a demonstration of the skills and knowledge gained during an internship in Machine Learning.

# App Look Disclaimer
As I am new to React Native, the app is kept simple and basic, with a focus on the functionality of the Computer Vision model. Despite its rough appearance, the project provides a solid foundation for future improvements and developments.
