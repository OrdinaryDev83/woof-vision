# Woof Vision
Woof Vision is a cutting-edge computer vision project that uses the state-of-the-art vit_l32 transformer model to recognize up to 120 different dog breeds from a single photo. This project showcases the transfer learning capabilities of TensorFlow and the power of using advanced algorithms in computer vision. The mobile app is built using React Native, while the backend is powered by Flask.

# Why
This project was created as a demonstration of the skills and knowledge gained during an internship in machine learning. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that explains the training process in detail, providing a deeper understanding of the model. It also showcases the usage of data augmentation, transfer learning and other techniques.

# App Look Disclaimer
As a new React Native developer, the app is kept simple and basic, with a focus on the functionality of the computer vision model. Despite its rough appearance, the project provides a solid foundation for future improvements and developments in the field of computer vision and machine learning.
